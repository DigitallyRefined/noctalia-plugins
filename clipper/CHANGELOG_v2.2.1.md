## Bug Fixes

#### Clear All Notes Fix
- Fixed the bug where you click Clear All Notes and reopen the plugin panel but the notes are still there

#### Panel Corners Fix
- Fixed the plugin's panel bottom corners has square corners when the top is rounded

#### Export Notes Fix
- Fixed you can export a Note many times but when deleting you can only delete one so the other notes still stucking inside your `~/Documents/` directory. Now you can still export a note many times, changing the contents and all the notes were exported from that one note will all be deleted

#### Applying Settings
- Settings will now only apply when you click the `Apply` button instead of immediately applying the settings (this is to make use of the apply button)
